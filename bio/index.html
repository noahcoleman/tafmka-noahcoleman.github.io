<p>Noah was born and raised near Chicago, IL.  Growing up, he was given numerous creative experiences that continue to influence his work today.  His curiosity and propensity for tinkering have directed him through diverse fields such as glassblowing, sculpture, and robotics.  In 2011, he received his BFA from Brigham Young University and is currently pursuing an MFA in Art and Technology Studies at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>
