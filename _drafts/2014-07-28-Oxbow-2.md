<h1>Not As Yet Titled</h1>

I made this piece as a part of [Charlotte Potter's]{http://charlottepotter.com} and [Kim Harty's]{http://kimharty.com} class, Video + Glass: Optics of the Lens.

Glassblowing is a very physical activity that requires both hands, but the left hand is often simply turning the pipe while the right hand tools and shapes the glass. I began noticing some of the quirky subconscious movements of the left hands of my teachers and classmates. I filmed their left hands as they worked with the glass, then performed their gestures with my own hand and projected it onto a bell jar.
