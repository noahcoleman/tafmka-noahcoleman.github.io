I made this piece as a part of [Charlotte Potter's](http://charlottepotter.com) and [Kim Harty's](http://kimharty.com) class, Video + Glass: Optics of the Lens.

Glassblowing requires both hands, but not equally.  The right hand is the more active hand--tooling and shaping the glass, while the left is usually just turning the pipe.  I realized this during this class.  After this realization, I began noticing some of the quirky subconscious movements of the left hands of my teachers and classmates. I filmed their left hands as they worked with the glass then performed their gestures with my own hand and projected it onto a bell jar.
