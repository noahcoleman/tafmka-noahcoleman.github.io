		<p>I create immersive experiences that quietly demand to be explored. &nbsp;Combining simple gestures with robotics, found materials, custom electronics, and glow in the dark paint, I create spaces that typify the nebulous areas between play, experience, ritual, and attention. &nbsp;This liminal space is rife with nuance and paradox. &nbsp;I seek to draw the viewer into this space, allowing them to explore it, examine details, and make connections as they navigate the in-between.
