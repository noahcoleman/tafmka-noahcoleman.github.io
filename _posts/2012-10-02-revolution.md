[{{page.title}}.](http://vimeo.com/56941581)  2012.  Wood, steel, aluminum, motor, nickel.

This piece was made for a show I participated in in 2012 called *E Pluribus Unum*.  I made this piece in reaction to a quote I found from Thomas Jefferson: "I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
