This piece was installed in Brigham Young University's SMArt Space in 2011.  The title of this piece came from Kierkegaard's *Repetition*: "But 
he who does not grasp that life is repetition and that this is the beauty 
of life, has condemned himself and deserves nothing better than 
what will happen to him â€” death."
