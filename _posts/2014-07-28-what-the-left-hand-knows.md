I made this piece as a part of [Charlotte Potter's](http://charlottepotter.com) and [Kim Harty's](http://kimharty.com) class, Video + Glass: Optics of the Lens.

Glassblowing requires both hands, but he right hand is usually the more active of the two.  The right hand tools and shapes the glass while the left hand usually just turns the pipe.  After realizing this detail, I began noticing some of the quirky, subconscious movements of the left hands of my teachers and classmates. I filmed their left hands as they worked, performed their gestures with my own hand, and projected my performance onto a bell jar.
