*Intraocular* is an experimental device designed to induce in its user a state of soft fascination.  Soft fascination is a term used to describe the passive experience of natural rhythms and patterns such as cloud formations, flowing water and rolling waves.  This piece began as an observation that nearly all the stimuli cited as inducing soft fascination are found in nature.  This device is the first outcome of an exploration of the implications of creating artificial soft fascination stimuli.
